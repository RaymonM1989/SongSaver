                Hey there! <br></br><br></br>
                This Song Saver was made using React, as an assignment for the Front-end course on Winc Academy. <br></br>
                It wasn't an easy assignment, and I got stuck a couple of times. Especially prop management needed some getting used to. <br></br>
                Everything worked fine when I built it in one file, but then when I started separating functional components from the render components things often stopped working.<br></br>
                It all worked out in the end, and that's what matters! I learned a lot during this project. <br></br><br></br>
                I added a lot of "extra" stuff which wasn't in the original assignment, but I had to draw the line somewhere and hand it in. <br></br>
                I hope you like the endresult. <br></br><br></br>
                Have a great day! <br></br>
            </p>
